Given a binary tree T, write a program to count the total number of sub-trees of T which is also a
Binary Search Tree (BST) and the sum of all the nodes of that BST is equal to the given sum k.
If no such sub-trees are present, print -1.
Input Format:
• The integers, if given, are in the range [−106
, 106
].
• First line of the input contains space separated Parenthesis Representation of the tree
T.
• Second line of the input contains the integer value k.
Output Format:
• Print the total number of BST whose sum is equal to given k. If no such sub-trees are present,
print -1.




Sample Input 1:
( 5 ( 4 ( 3 ( ) ( ) ) ( 3 ( ) ( ) ) ) ( 6 ( 1 ( ) ( ) ) ( 9 ( ) ( ) ) ) )
13
Sample Output 1:
2



Sample Input 2:
( 5 ( 4 ( 3 ( ) ( ) ) ( 3 ( ) ( ) ) ) ( 6 ( 1 ( ) ( ) ) ( 9 ( ) ( ) ) ) )
2
Sample Output 2:
